/**
 * Production OTA rollback.
 *
 * Re-publishes an EXISTING update group to the production branch. Unlike
 * scripts/ota-prod.mjs this builds nothing: `eas update:republish` reuses the
 * bytes of the chosen group, so the DEV/PROD env trap does not apply (the
 * group was already bundle-scanned when it was first published) and the
 * runtime version stays whatever that group was built for — which is the
 * point: after a version bump in app.json a fresh `eas update` can no longer
 * reach the older runtime, but a republish can.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/ota-rollback.mjs                 # lists recent groups, picks nothing
 *   node scripts/ota-rollback.mjs <group-id>      # republishes that group
 *   node scripts/ota-rollback.mjs --group <id>    # same
