IMPORTANT: For each activity, include:
- Realistic entry prices in EUR that RESPECT the budget tier (${budgetGuidance.budgetTier})
- Whether "Skip the Line" tickets are available (for museums, attractions)${budgetGuidance.budgetTier === "low" ? " — only suggest if affordable within budget" : budgetGuidance.budgetTier === "moderate" ? " — suggest for popular attractions only" : ""}
- Skip the Line price (usually 5-15€ more than regular)
- Duration of the activity in minutes
- Start time and end time (24h format like "09:00", "11:30")
- FULL ADDRESS: Include street name/number, neighborhood, and "${trip.destination}" (e.g., "Piazza del Duomo, 20121 Milan" or "Gothic Quarter, Barcelona"). This is CRITICAL for accurate map directions.

**TIME-AWARE ITINERARY WITH TRAVEL SEGMENTS:**
Between consecutive activities, include realistic travel time based on typical walking distance in ${trip.destination}. Consider:
- City center attractions are usually 10-20 min walk apart
- Activities in different neighborhoods may need 25-40 min walking
- Museums/attractions typically need 1.5-3 hours each
- Meals at restaurants typically last 45-90 minutes

For local experiences (cooking classes, workshops, food tours, neighborhood walks, etc.):
- Set "isLocalExperience": true
- Set "type": "local-experience"
- Include a detailed description of what makes it authentic/local

Include specific activities, restaurants, and attractions for each day. Format as JSON with structure:

      "day": 1,
      "date": "2024-01-15",

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**ACTIVITY TIMING RULES:**
- First activity of each day: set "travelFromPrevious" to null
- Subsequent activities: include realistic travel time from previous location
- startTime of next activity = previous endTime + walking time
- Ensure no time gaps or overlaps - schedule realistically
- Allow 15-30 min buffer for transit between different areas

**REMINDER: ${timeAwareGuidance.skipLastDay 
    ? `Generate Days 1-${effectiveTripDays} with activities. Day ${tripDays} is departure-only with no activities.` 
    : `Generate ALL ${tripDays} days from Day 1 to Day ${tripDays}.`} Each full day MUST have EXACTLY ${budgetGuidance.budgetTier === 'low' ? '2' : budgetGuidance.budgetTier === 'moderate' ? '3' : budgetGuidance.budgetTier === 'high' ? '4' : '5'} total items (activities + meals combined). Do NOT exceed this number. Partial days (arrival/departure) should have fewer items.**

**BUDGET COMPLIANCE:** This is a ${budgetGuidance.budgetTier.toUpperCase()} budget trip (€${budgetGuidance.dailyBudgetPerPerson}/person/day). ${budgetGuidance.budgetTier === 'low' ? 'HARD LIMIT: 2 items per day (activities + meals). Maximum 1 paid activity. Prioritize free attractions and affordable food.' : budgetGuidance.budgetTier === 'moderate' ? 'HARD LIMIT: 3 items per day (activities + meals). Do NOT add more than 3. Balance quality and value at around €' + budgetGuidance.dailyBudgetPerPerson + ' per person daily.' : budgetGuidance.budgetTier === 'high' ? 'Target 4 items per day (activities + meals). Include guided tours and unique experiences. Daily spend up to €' + budgetGuidance.dailyBudgetPerPerson + ' per person.' : 'Target 5 curated items per day (activities + meals). Include exclusive activities and fine dining. Daily spend up to €' + budgetGuidance.dailyBudgetPerPerson + ' per person.'}

Make sure prices are realistic for ${trip.destination} and aligned with the ${budgetGuidance.budgetTier.toUpperCase()} budget tier. Distribute spending evenly across days. Museums typically cost €10-25, skip-the-line adds €5-15. Tours cost €20-80. Restaurants show average meal cost per person.`;
